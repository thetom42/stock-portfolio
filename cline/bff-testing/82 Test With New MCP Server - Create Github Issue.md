To create a GitHub issue, I need to use the github MCP server's create_issue tool. Based on the task, I need to:
1. Create an issue with title about fixing failed Postman tests for Categories collection
2. Add a "bug" label
3. Write a good description explaining the problem and context

The required parameters for create_issue are:

- owner: Not provided, need to ask user
- repo: Not provided, need to ask user
- title: Can infer from task - "Fix failed Postman test runs for Stock Portfolio BFF - Categories collection"
- body: Will write a detailed description
- labels: ["bug"]

I need to ask the user for the GitHub repository owner and repo name before proceeding.
</thinking>

<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the GitHub repository owner and repository name where I should create this issue? For example, if the repository URL is https://github.com/thetom42/stock-portfolio, the owner would be "thetom42" and the repo would be "stock-portfolio".</question>

The GitHub MCP server returned a "Resource not found" error when trying to create the issue. This suggests the GitHub MCP server may not be properly configured or running. I need to verify the GitHub MCP server configuration.

I'll check the MCP settings file to see if the GitHub server is properly configured.

The GitHub MCP server configuration appears correct with a valid GitHub token. The error suggests the repository "stock-portfolio" under owner "thetom42" may not exist or the token doesn't have access.

I need to verify if the repository exists and is accessible with the current token. I'll use the github MCP server's search_repositories tool to check.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The GitHub MCP server is consistently failing with "Resource not found" errors despite the repository being accessible. This suggests there may be an issue with the GitHub MCP server configuration or the GitHub token permissions.

Since I'm unable to create the issue programmatically, I'll provide the complete issue details that can be manually created in GitHub:

1. Title: "Fix failed Postman test runs for Stock Portfolio BFF - Categories collection"
2. Labels: "bug"
3. Description:

```
The Postman test collection for Categories in the Stock Portfolio BFF is currently failing. This needs to be investigated and fixed to ensure proper functionality of the Categories API endpoints.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run the Stock Portfolio BFF - Categories Postman collection
2. Observe test failures

**Expected Behavior:**
All tests in the Categories collection should pass

**Actual Behavior:**
Multiple tests are failing

**Additional Context:**
This is impacting our ability to verify the correctness of the Categories API implementation. The failing tests should be analyzed to determine if they are due to:
- Incorrect test assertions
- Actual bugs in the Categories API implementation  
- Issues with test data setup

Priority should be given to fixing these test failures to maintain confidence in our API quality.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The GitHub MCP server is still failing with "Resource not found" errors despite the new token. Since the repository exists and is accessible, this suggests there may be an issue with the MCP server configuration itself.

Given this persistent issue, I'll provide the complete issue details again that can be manually created in GitHub. The user can create this issue directly through the GitHub UI at: <https://github.com/thetom42/stock-portfolio/issues/new>

Title: Fix failed Postman test runs for Stock Portfolio BFF - Categories collection
Labels: bug
Description:
The Postman test collection for Categories in the Stock Portfolio BFF is currently failing. This needs to be investigated and fixed to ensure proper functionality of the Categories API endpoints.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the Stock Portfolio BFF - Categories Postman collection
2. Observe test failures

**Expected Behavior:**
All tests in the Categories collection should pass

**Actual Behavior:**
Multiple tests are failing

**Additional Context:**
This is impacting our ability to verify the correctness of the Categories API implementation. The failing tests should be analyzed to determine if they are due to:

- Incorrect test assertions
- Actual bugs in the Categories API implementation
- Issues with test data setup

Priority should be given to fixing these test failures to maintain confidence in our API quality.

Maybe the token has not the sufficient access rights. What scope should I configure the token to?

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
For the GitHub MCP server to work properly, the GitHub token needs the following scopes:

1. repo - Full control of private repositories (required for creating issues)
2. write:discussion - Write access to discussions
3. read:org - Read-only access to organization membership

The token should be configured with these scopes to ensure it has sufficient permissions to create issues and perform other repository operations.

Here are the steps to create a new token with the correct permissions:

1. Go to GitHub Developer Settings: <https://github.com/settings/tokens>
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Select "Fine-grained tokens"
4. Set the following permissions:
   - Repository access: All repositories
   - Permissions:
     - Issues: Read and write
     - Metadata: Read-only
5. Generate the token and update it in the MCP settings

Once the new token is configured, I can retry creating the issue.
</thinking>

<ask_followup_question>
<question>
Please create a new GitHub token with the following permissions:

1. Repository access: All repositories
2. Permissions:
   - Issues: Read and write
   - Metadata: Read-only

Then update the token in the MCP settings and let me know when done so I can retry creating the issue.

The GitHub token has been updated with the correct permissions. I'll now attempt to create the issue again using the GitHub MCP server.
