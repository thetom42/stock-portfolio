<task>
Look at the db/design-proposal.md and into the discussion about it in db/design-discussion.md. It's all about the design of the db layer of our Stock Portfolio Application. Can you please pick up the proposal, take into account the additional points to consider inside the discussion document and write us a detailed and thorough Design document into a new file "db/design.md". Therefore work through the whole list of the "Recommendation" section inside the proposal, add the additional points that are made in the discussion to this list and give is a long but precise in-depth design for the db layer. For each section of your design document come up with good examples and reflect about what is the impact on the file structure of the db folder. Finally give us for the concrete tools stack we can use for implementing the design as well as the next steps we should take.
Do not implement anything, only write the design document as mentioned before, but you can use code examples inside the document where it is appropriate.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The task is to create a design document for the database layer of a Stock Portfolio Application.  The design should incorporate information from `db/design-proposal.md` and `db/design-discussion.md`. The output should be a new markdown file, `db/design.md`, containing a detailed design, examples, impact on the file structure, technology stack, and next steps.  I will need to read both markdown files to gather the necessary information.

First, I will use the `read_file` tool to get the contents of `db/design-proposal.md` and `db/design-discussion.md`. Then, I will analyze the content of both files and create a new markdown file `db/design.md` using the `write_to_file` tool.

# Database Layer Design Options

## Overview
This document outlines design options for implementing a database abstraction layer that supports multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite) for the stock portfolio application.

## Design Patterns & Architecture Options

### 1. Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter Pattern
#### Description
- Implement a repository interface for each domain entity (Portfolio, Stock, Transaction, etc.)
- Use Strategy/Adapter pattern to switch between different database implementations
- Each database provider implements the repository interfaces

#### Benefits
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new database providers
- Domain logic remains isolated from data access logic
- Testable through interface mocking

#### Structure
```
db/
  ├── interfaces/         # Repository interfaces
  ├── providers/         # Database-specific implementations
  │   ├── postgresql/
  │   └── sqlite/
  └── repositories/      # Concrete repository implementations
```

### 2. Data Mapper Pattern with Factory
#### Description
- Implement data mappers that handle the transformation between domain objects and database records
- Use factory pattern to create appropriate data mapper instances
- Database-specific logic encapsulated in mapper implementations

#### Benefits
- Clear separation between domain objects and database records
- Flexible object-relational mapping
- Good for complex domain models

### 3. Active Record with Provider Abstraction
#### Description
- Domain models include data access methods
- Abstract database operations behind provider interface
- Models use provider interface for operations

#### Benefits
- Simpler implementation for straightforward CRUD operations
- Less boilerplate code
- Good for simpler domain models

### 4. Plugin Pattern
#### Description
- Define a plugin interface for database operations
- Allow database providers to be loaded dynamically at runtime

   - Provides clean separation of concerns
   - Makes testing straightforward
   - Allows easy addition of new database providers

2. **Complementary Pattern**: Plugin Pattern
   - While the Repository Pattern provides the core architecture, incorporating aspects of the Plugin Pattern offers valuable extensibility
   - Enables future third-party database provider integration
   - Allows for dynamic provider loading without application rebuilds
   - Consider implementing for non-critical database providers or experimental features

3. **Language/ORM**: TypeScript with Prisma
   - Type safety
   - Excellent developer experience
   - Good integration with Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem
   - Strong migration support
   - Matches the existing project stack (based on the BFF folder structure)

4. **Key Utilities to Implement**:
   - Migration management system
   - Seeding system for test data
   - Integration test helpers
   - Connection pooling and management
   - Query logging for development
   - Plugin management system for dynamic provider loading

This combination provides a robust foundation while maintaining flexibility for future changes and additions to the database layer.

# Database Design Review

This document provides a review of the database design proposal outlined in `design.md`.

## Summary of the Proposal

The proposal outlines several architectural patterns for the database layer, including the Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter, Data Mapper, Active Record, and the Plugin Pattern.  It also suggests using TypeScript with Prisma as the primary language and ORM.  The recommendation is to use the Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter as the primary pattern, complemented by the Plugin Pattern for extensibility.  Key utilities such as migration management, seeding, testing helpers, and connection pooling are also recommended.

## Review and Discussion

The proposed design is well-structured and considers several important aspects of database design. The choice of the Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter is a solid choice, promoting clean separation of concerns and testability.  The addition of the Plugin Pattern is a good approach for future extensibility and the ability to support additional database providers without significant code changes.  The selection of TypeScript with Prisma aligns well with the existing project stack and offers a good developer experience.

Here are some additional points to consider:

* **Error Handling:** The design document doesn't explicitly address error handling.  A robust error handling strategy should be implemented to manage database exceptions, connection issues, and other potential problems.  Consider using a centralized error handling mechanism that provides consistent error reporting and logging.

* **Transaction Management:**  The document should clarify how transactions will be managed.  For data integrity, it's crucial to define how transactions will be handled across different database operations.  This should include considerations for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

* **Data Validation:**  While data validation is mentioned in the context of utility scripts, it's important to explicitly define where and how data validation will be performed.  Consider implementing validation at multiple layers, including the application layer, service layer, and potentially even within the database layer using constraints and triggers.

* **Performance Considerations:**  The design should address performance considerations, such as connection pooling, query optimization, and indexing strategies.  These aspects are crucial for ensuring the application's responsiveness and scalability.

* **Security:**  Security considerations should be included, such as secure connection management, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, and appropriate access control mechanisms.

* **Specific Prisma Considerations:**  While Prisma is a good choice, the document should specify how Prisma's features, such as migrations and schema management, will be integrated into the development workflow.

* **Plugin Management Details:**  The Plugin Pattern is a good idea, but the document should provide more details on how plugins will be managed, loaded, and unloaded.  Consider using a plugin manager library or implementing a custom solution.


Overall, the proposed database design is well-considered and provides a solid foundation for the application.  Addressing the points mentioned above will further enhance the design's robustness, security, and maintainability.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application.  It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review.  The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic.  The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities:

* **User:**  `id`, `username`, `password`, `email`
* **Portfolio:** `id`, `userId`, `name`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
* **Stock:** `symbol`, `name`, `sector`, `industry` (Note: This is a lookup table, not a full stock data store)
* **Holding:** `id`, `portfolioId`, `stockSymbol`, `quantity`, `purchasePrice`, `purchaseDate`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
* **Transaction:** `id`, `holdingId`, `type` (BUY, SELL), `quantity`, `price`, `date`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
* **Quote:** `symbol`, `price`, `timestamp` (Note: This is a cache table for recent quotes)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Portfolios table
CREATE TABLE portfolios (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    userId INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- and so on...
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern will be implemented using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: number): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: number): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern will allow for dynamic loading of database providers.  A plugin interface will define the necessary methods for each provider.  A plugin loader will be responsible for loading and managing plugins at runtime.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A centralized error handling mechanism will be implemented to manage database exceptions and other errors.  Errors will be logged and appropriate responses will be returned to the client.

## Transaction Management

Transactions will be managed using database-specific transaction mechanisms (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` in PostgreSQL).  All database operations within a single business transaction will be wrapped in a transaction block to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

## Data Validation

Data validation will be performed at multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer:**  Input validation will be performed before data is passed to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer:**  Additional validation will be performed in the service layer to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Layer:** Database constraints and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.

## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:**  A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:**  Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:**  Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:**  Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:**  Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes.  Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:**  Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture.  The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A centralized error handling mechanism will be implemented to manage database exceptions and other errors.  Errors will be logged and appropriate responses will be returned to the client.

Transactions will be managed using database-specific transaction mechanisms (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` in PostgreSQL).  All database operations within a single business transaction will be wrapped in a transaction block to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes.  Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:**  Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture.  The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application.  It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review.  The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic.  The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities:

* **User:**  `id`, `username`, `password`, `email`
* **Portfolio:** `id`, `userId`, `name`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
* **Stock:** `symbol`, `name`, `sector`, `industry` (Note: This is a lookup table, not a full stock data store)
* **Holding:** `id`, `portfolioId`, `stockSymbol`, `quantity`, `purchasePrice`, `purchaseDate`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
* **Transaction:** `id`, `holdingId`, `type` (BUY, SELL), `quantity`, `price`, `date`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
* **Quote:** `symbol`, `price`, `timestamp` (Note: This is a cache table for recent quotes)
* **Category:** `id`, `name`, `description` (Optional:  Could be used for categorizing stocks or portfolios)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Portfolios table
CREATE TABLE portfolios (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    userId INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- and so on...
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern will be implemented using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: number): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: number): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern will allow for dynamic loading of database providers.  A plugin interface will define the necessary methods for each provider.  A plugin loader will be responsible for loading and managing plugins at runtime.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A centralized error handling mechanism will be implemented to manage database exceptions and other errors.  Errors will be logged and appropriate responses will be returned to the client.

## Transaction Management

Transactions will be managed using database-specific transaction mechanisms (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` in PostgreSQL).  All database operations within a single business transaction will be wrapped in a transaction block to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

## Data Validation

Data validation will be performed at multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer:**  Input validation will be performed before data is passed to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer:**  Additional validation will be performed in the service layer to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Layer:** Database constraints and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.

## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:**  A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:**  Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:**  Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:**  Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:**  Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes.  Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:**  Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture.  The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transactions_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    holdings_id TEXT REFERENCES holdings(holdings_id),
    buy BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    transaction_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    amount INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    commission DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    broker TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Quotes table
CREATE TABLE quotes (
    quotes_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    isin TEXT REFERENCES stocks(isin),
    price DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    currency TEXT NOT NULL,
    market_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    exchange TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Portfolios table
CREATE TABLE portfolios (
    portfolios_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    users_id TEXT REFERENCES users(users_id)
);

-- Holdings table
CREATE TABLE holdings (
    holdings_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    portfolios_id TEXT REFERENCES portfolios(portfolios_id),
    isin TEXT REFERENCES stocks(isin),
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE
);

-- Transactions table
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transactions_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    holdings_id TEXT REFERENCES holdings(holdings_id),
    buy BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    transaction_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    amount INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    commission DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    broker TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A centralized error handling mechanism will be implemented to manage database exceptions and other errors. Errors will be logged and appropriate responses will be returned to the client.

## Transaction Management

Transactions will be managed using database-specific transaction mechanisms (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` in PostgreSQL). All database operations within a single business transaction will be wrapped in a transaction block to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

## Data Validation

Data validation will be performed at multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Input validation will be performed before data is passed to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer:** Additional validation will be performed in the service layer to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Layer:** Database constraints and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.

## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:** Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:** Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: [db/model.png](db/model.png).


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A centralized error handling mechanism will be implemented to manage database exceptions and other errors. Errors will be logged and appropriate responses will be returned to the client.

## Transaction Management

Transactions will be managed using database-specific transaction mechanisms (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` in PostgreSQL). All database operations within a single business transaction will be wrapped in a transaction block to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

## Data Validation

Data validation will be performed at multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Input validation will be performed before data is passed to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer:** Additional validation will be performed in the service layer to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Layer:** Database constraints and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.

## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:** Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:** Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transactions will be managed using database-specific transaction mechanisms (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` in PostgreSQL). All database operations within a single business transaction will be wrapped in a transaction block to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

## Data Validation

Data validation will be performed at multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Input validation will be performed before data is passed to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer:** Additional validation will be performed in the service layer to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Layer:** Database constraints and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.

## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:** Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:** Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `error-handling` subfolder will be added.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

  }
}

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function

    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();

  }

    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });

This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation will be performed at multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Input validation will be performed before data is passed to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer:** Additional validation will be performed in the service layer to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Layer:** Database constraints and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.

## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:** Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:** Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation will be performed at multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Input validation will be performed before data is passed to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer:** Additional validation will be performed in the service layer to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Layer:** Database constraints and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.

## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:** Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:** Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `transaction-management` subfolder will be added.

```

│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/

│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
├── transaction-management/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.  A multi-layered approach will be implemented, combining validation at the application layer, service layer, and database layer.

**1. Application Layer Validation:**  Input validation will be performed at the application layer before data is passed to the service layer.  This initial validation will check for basic data types, required fields, and format constraints.  Libraries like Joi or Zod can be used for this purpose.

**2. Service Layer Validation:**  The service layer will perform additional validation to ensure data consistency and business rules are met.  This might include checking for data conflicts, verifying relationships between entities, and performing more complex validation logic.

**3. Database Layer Validation:**  Database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.  This ensures that invalid data cannot be inserted or updated into the database.

**Example (TypeScript - Application Layer with Joi):**

```typescript
// Assuming you are using Joi for validation
import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:** Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:** Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.  A multi-layered approach will be implemented, combining validation at the application layer, service layer, and database layer.

**1. Application Layer Validation:**  Input validation will be performed at the application layer before data is passed to the service layer.  This initial validation will check for basic data types, required fields, and format constraints.  Libraries like Joi or Zod can be used for this purpose.

**2. Service Layer Validation:**  The service layer will perform additional validation to ensure data consistency and business rules are met.  This might include checking for data conflicts, verifying relationships between entities, and performing more complex validation logic.

**3. Database Layer Validation:**  Database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.  This ensures that invalid data cannot be inserted or updated into the database.

**Example (TypeScript - Application Layer with Joi):**

```typescript
// Assuming you are using Joi for validation
import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Performance will be addressed through:

* **Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Query Optimization:** Queries will be optimized to minimize database load.
* **Indexing:** Appropriate indexes will be created to improve query performance.

## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `transaction-management` subfolder will be added.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/

│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
├── transaction-management/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Database performance is critical for a responsive and scalable application.  The following strategies will be implemented to ensure optimal performance:

**1. Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.  This avoids the overhead of establishing new connections for each database operation, significantly improving performance, especially under high load.  The pool size will be configured based on the expected load and available resources.

**2. Query Optimization:**  Database queries will be optimized to minimize resource consumption.  This includes using appropriate indexes, avoiding unnecessary joins, and using efficient query patterns.  Query execution plans will be analyzed using database tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.  The ORM (Prisma) will be leveraged for its built-in query optimization capabilities.

**3. Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.  The choice of indexes will depend on the application's query patterns and data access needs.  Index usage will be monitored to ensure that indexes are effective and not causing performance degradation in other areas.

**4. Caching:**  Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., stock quotes) will reduce the load on the database.  A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) will be implemented to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries.  The cache invalidation strategy will be carefully designed to ensure data consistency.

**5. Database Tuning:**  The database server will be tuned to optimize performance.  This includes configuring parameters such as buffer pool size, connection limits, and other performance-related settings.  Database monitoring tools will be used to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

**6. Read Replicas (Future Consideration):**  For high-read-load scenarios, read replicas can be implemented to distribute the read load across multiple database servers.  This will improve the responsiveness of read-heavy operations.

**7. Database Sharding (Future Consideration):**  For very large datasets, database sharding can be implemented to distribute data across multiple database servers.  This will improve scalability and performance for very large datasets.


**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these performance optimizations will not significantly alter the project's overall structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the ORM (Prisma), and the caching mechanism.  Monitoring tools will need to be integrated to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.


## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `transaction-management` subfolder will be added.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
├── transaction-management/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.  A multi-layered approach will be implemented, combining validation at the application layer, service layer, and database layer.

**1. Application Layer Validation:**  Input validation will be performed at the application layer before data is passed to the service layer.  This initial validation will check for basic data types, required fields, and format constraints.  Libraries like Joi or Zod can be used for this purpose.

**2. Service Layer Validation:**  The service layer will perform additional validation to ensure data consistency and business rules are met.  This might include checking for data conflicts, verifying relationships between entities, and performing more complex validation logic.

**3. Database Layer Validation:**  Database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.  This ensures that invalid data cannot be inserted or updated into the database.

**Example (TypeScript - Application Layer with Joi):**

```typescript
// Assuming you are using Joi for validation
import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Database performance is critical for a responsive and scalable application.  The following strategies will be implemented to ensure optimal performance:

**1. Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.  This avoids the overhead of establishing new connections for each database operation, significantly improving performance, especially under high load.  The pool size will be configured based on the expected load and available resources.

**2. Query Optimization:**  Database queries will be optimized to minimize resource consumption.  This includes using appropriate indexes, avoiding unnecessary joins, and using efficient query patterns.  Query execution plans will be analyzed using database tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.  The ORM (Prisma) will be leveraged for its built-in query optimization capabilities.

**3. Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.  The choice of indexes will depend on the application's query patterns and data access needs.  Index usage will be monitored to ensure that indexes are effective and not causing performance degradation in other areas.

**4. Caching:**  Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., stock quotes) will reduce the load on the database.  A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) will be implemented to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries.  The cache invalidation strategy will be carefully designed to ensure data consistency.

**5. Database Tuning:**  The database server will be tuned to optimize performance.  This includes configuring parameters such as buffer pool size, connection limits, and other performance-related settings.  Database monitoring tools will be used to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

**6. Read Replicas (Future Consideration):**  For high-read-load scenarios, read replicas can be implemented to distribute the read load across multiple database servers.  This will improve the responsiveness of read-heavy operations.

**7. Database Sharding (Future Consideration):**  For very large datasets, database sharding can be implemented to distribute data across multiple database servers.  This will improve scalability and performance for very large datasets.


**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these performance optimizations will not significantly alter the project's overall structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the ORM (Prisma), and the caching mechanism.  Monitoring tools will need to be integrated to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.


## Security

Security will be addressed through:

* **Secure Connection Management:** Secure connections will be established using SSL/TLS.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** Appropriate access control mechanisms will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Prisma's migration system will be used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be version-controlled and applied automatically during deployment.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `transaction-management` subfolder will be added.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/

│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
├── transaction-management/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.  A multi-layered approach will be implemented, combining validation at the application layer, service layer, and database layer.

**1. Application Layer Validation:**  Input validation will be performed at the application layer before data is passed to the service layer.  This initial validation will check for basic data types, required fields, and format constraints.  Libraries like Joi or Zod can be used for this purpose.

**2. Service Layer Validation:**  The service layer will perform additional validation to ensure data consistency and business rules are met.  This might include checking for data conflicts, verifying relationships between entities, and performing more complex validation logic.

**3. Database Layer Validation:**  Database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.  This ensures that invalid data cannot be inserted or updated into the database.

**Example (TypeScript - Application Layer with Joi):**

```typescript
// Assuming you are using Joi for validation
import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Database performance is critical for a responsive and scalable application.  The following strategies will be implemented to ensure optimal performance:

**1. Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.  This avoids the overhead of establishing new connections for each database operation, significantly improving performance, especially under high load.  The pool size will be configured based on the expected load and available resources.

**2. Query Optimization:**  Database queries will be optimized to minimize resource consumption.  This includes using appropriate indexes, avoiding unnecessary joins, and using efficient query patterns.  Query execution plans will be analyzed using database tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.  The ORM (Prisma) will be leveraged for its built-in query optimization capabilities.

**3. Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.  The choice of indexes will depend on the application's query patterns and data access needs.  Index usage will be monitored to ensure that indexes are effective and not causing performance degradation in other areas.

**4. Caching:**  Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., stock quotes) will reduce the load on the database.  A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) will be implemented to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries.  The cache invalidation strategy will be carefully designed to ensure data consistency.

**5. Database Tuning:**  The database server will be tuned to optimize performance.  This includes configuring parameters such as buffer pool size, connection limits, and other performance-related settings.  Database monitoring tools will be used to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

**6. Read Replicas (Future Consideration):**  For high-read-load scenarios, read replicas can be implemented to distribute the read load across multiple database servers.  This will improve the responsiveness of read-heavy operations.

**7. Database Sharding (Future Consideration):**  For very large datasets, database sharding can be implemented to distribute data across multiple database servers.  This will improve scalability and performance for very large datasets.


**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these performance optimizations will not significantly alter the project's overall structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the ORM (Prisma), and the caching mechanism.  Monitoring tools will need to be integrated to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.


## Security

Security is paramount for any application handling sensitive financial data.  The following security measures will be implemented:

**1. Secure Connection Management:** All database connections will be established using SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.  This prevents eavesdropping and ensures that sensitive data is not intercepted by unauthorized parties.  The use of strong encryption ciphers will be enforced.

**2. Input Sanitization and Parameterized Queries:**  All user inputs will be carefully sanitized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Parameterized queries will be used consistently to prevent malicious code from being injected into database queries.  This is a fundamental security measure to protect against SQL injection attacks.

**3. Access Control:**  A robust access control mechanism will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.  This will involve defining roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific data and perform certain operations.  The principle of least privilege will be strictly adhered to, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

**4. Data Encryption:**  Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, financial information) will be encrypted at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.  This protects data even if the database server is compromised.  Key management will be implemented securely, using appropriate key rotation and protection mechanisms.

**5. Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.  These audits will help ensure that the database remains secure and protected against evolving threats.

**6. Secure Password Handling:**  Passwords will be stored using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with appropriate salting and peppering techniques.  This prevents passwords from being easily cracked even if the database is compromised.

**7. Regular Software Updates:**  The database software and related libraries will be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.

**8. Principle of Least Privilege:**  Database users will be granted only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.  This limits the potential damage caused by a compromised account.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these security measures will not significantly change the overall project structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the use of secure coding practices, and the integration of security tools and libraries.  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be incorporated into the development lifecycle.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder.

if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);

    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');

**8. Principle of Least Privilege:**  Database users will be granted only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.  This limits the potential damage caused by a compromised account.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these security measures will not significantly change the overall project structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the use of secure coding practices, and the integration of security tools and libraries.  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be incorporated into the development lifecycle.

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.  A multi-layered approach will be implemented, combining validation at the application layer, service layer, and database layer.

**1. Application Layer Validation:**  Input validation will be performed at the application layer before data is passed to the service layer.  This initial validation will check for basic data types, required fields, and format constraints.  Libraries like Joi or Zod can be used for this purpose.

**2. Service Layer Validation:**  The service layer will perform additional validation to ensure data consistency and business rules are met.  This might include checking for data conflicts, verifying relationships between entities, and performing more complex validation logic.

**3. Database Layer Validation:**  Database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.  This ensures that invalid data cannot be inserted or updated into the database.

**Example (TypeScript - Application Layer with Joi):**

```typescript
// Assuming you are using Joi for validation
import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Database performance is critical for a responsive and scalable application.  The following strategies will be implemented to ensure optimal performance:

**1. Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.  This avoids the overhead of establishing new connections for each database operation, significantly improving performance, especially under high load.  The pool size will be configured based on the expected load and available resources.

**2. Query Optimization:**  Database queries will be optimized to minimize resource consumption.  This includes using appropriate indexes, avoiding unnecessary joins, and using efficient query patterns.  Query execution plans will be analyzed using database tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.  The ORM (Prisma) will be leveraged for its built-in query optimization capabilities.

**3. Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.  The choice of indexes will depend on the application's query patterns and data access needs.  Index usage will be monitored to ensure that indexes are effective and not causing performance degradation in other areas.

**4. Caching:**  Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., stock quotes) will reduce the load on the database.  A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) will be implemented to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries.  The cache invalidation strategy will be carefully designed to ensure data consistency.

**5. Database Tuning:**  The database server will be tuned to optimize performance.  This includes configuring parameters such as buffer pool size, connection limits, and other performance-related settings.  Database monitoring tools will be used to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

**6. Read Replicas (Future Consideration):**  For high-read-load scenarios, read replicas can be implemented to distribute the read load across multiple database servers.  This will improve the responsiveness of read-heavy operations.

**7. Database Sharding (Future Consideration):**  For very large datasets, database sharding can be implemented to distribute data across multiple database servers.  This will improve scalability and performance for very large datasets.


**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these performance optimizations will not significantly alter the project's overall structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the ORM (Prisma), and the caching mechanism.  Monitoring tools will need to be integrated to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.


## Security

Security is paramount for any application handling sensitive financial data.  The following security measures will be implemented:

**1. Secure Connection Management:** All database connections will be established using SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.  This prevents eavesdropping and ensures that sensitive data is not intercepted by unauthorized parties.  The use of strong encryption ciphers will be enforced.

**2. Input Sanitization and Parameterized Queries:**  All user inputs will be carefully sanitized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Parameterized queries will be used consistently to prevent malicious code from being injected into database queries.  This is a fundamental security measure to protect against SQL injection attacks.

**3. Access Control:**  A robust access control mechanism will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.  This will involve defining roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific data and perform certain operations.  The principle of least privilege will be strictly adhered to, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

**4. Data Encryption:**  Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, financial information) will be encrypted at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.  This protects data even if the database server is compromised.  Key management will be implemented securely, using appropriate key rotation and protection mechanisms.

**5. Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.  These audits will help ensure that the database remains secure and protected against evolving threats.

**6. Secure Password Handling:**  Passwords will be stored using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with appropriate salting and peppering techniques.  This prevents passwords from being easily cracked even if the database is compromised.

**7. Regular Software Updates:**  The database software and related libraries will be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.

**8. Principle of Least Privilege:**  Database users will be granted only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.  This limits the potential damage caused by a compromised account.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these security measures will not significantly change the overall project structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the use of secure coding practices, and the integration of security tools and libraries.  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be incorporated into the development lifecycle.


## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Managing database schema changes effectively is crucial for maintaining a robust and reliable database.  This section details the migration strategy for the Stock Portfolio Application.

**1. Version Control:** All database migrations will be version-controlled using a dedicated system (e.g., Git).  This allows for tracking changes, reverting to previous versions if necessary, and ensuring that migrations are applied consistently across different environments.

**2. Migration Files:**  Each migration will be represented by a separate file containing the SQL statements required to update the database schema.  These files will be named according to a consistent convention (e.g., `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`).  This approach ensures that migrations are easily identifiable and manageable.

**3. Atomic Migrations:**  Each migration file will contain a single, atomic migration.  This ensures that if a migration fails, the database remains in a consistent state.  Partial migrations are avoided.

**4. Up and Down Migrations:**  Each migration will include both "up" and "down" migration scripts.  The "up" script applies the changes, while the "down" script reverts them.  This allows for easy rollback of migrations if necessary.

**5. Migration Tooling:**  Prisma's migration system will be used to manage the migration process.  This provides a convenient and reliable way to apply and rollback migrations.  The Prisma CLI will be used to generate, apply, and manage migration files.

**6. Testing Migrations:**  Migrations will be thoroughly tested before deployment to prevent unexpected issues.  This might involve running the migrations against a test database and verifying that the schema changes are applied correctly.

**7. Deployment Process:**  The migration process will be integrated into the application's deployment pipeline.  This ensures that migrations are applied automatically during deployment, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistency across environments.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A dedicated directory (e.g., `db/migrations`) will be created to store the migration files.  The migration process will be integrated into the deployment pipeline.  This structured approach ensures that database schema changes are managed effectively and reliably.


## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `transaction-management` subfolder will be added.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
├── transaction-management/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.

The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.  A multi-layered approach will be implemented, combining validation at the application layer, service layer, and database layer.

**1. Application Layer Validation:**  Input validation will be performed at the application layer before data is passed to the service layer.  This initial validation will check for basic data types, required fields, and format constraints.  Libraries like Joi or Zod can be used for this purpose.

**2. Service Layer Validation:**  The service layer will perform additional validation to ensure data consistency and business rules are met.  This might include checking for data conflicts, verifying relationships between entities, and performing more complex validation logic.

**3. Database Layer Validation:**  Database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.  This ensures that invalid data cannot be inserted or updated into the database.

**Example (TypeScript - Application Layer with Joi):**

```typescript
// Assuming you are using Joi for validation
import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Database performance is critical for a responsive and scalable application.  The following strategies will be implemented to ensure optimal performance:

**1. Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.  This avoids the overhead of establishing new connections for each database operation, significantly improving performance, especially under high load.  The pool size will be configured based on the expected load and available resources.

**2. Query Optimization:**  Database queries will be optimized to minimize resource consumption.  This includes using appropriate indexes, avoiding unnecessary joins, and using efficient query patterns.  Query execution plans will be analyzed using database tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.  The ORM (Prisma) will be leveraged for its built-in query optimization capabilities.

**3. Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.  The choice of indexes will depend on the application's query patterns and data access needs.  Index usage will be monitored to ensure that indexes are effective and not causing performance degradation in other areas.

**4. Caching:**  Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., stock quotes) will reduce the load on the database.  A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) will be implemented to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries.  The cache invalidation strategy will be carefully designed to ensure data consistency.

**5. Database Tuning:**  The database server will be tuned to optimize performance.  This includes configuring parameters such as buffer pool size, connection limits, and other performance-related settings.  Database monitoring tools will be used to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

**6. Read Replicas (Future Consideration):**  For high-read-load scenarios, read replicas can be implemented to distribute the read load across multiple database servers.  This will improve the responsiveness of read-heavy operations.

**7. Database Sharding (Future Consideration):**  For very large datasets, database sharding can be implemented to distribute data across multiple database servers.  This will improve scalability and performance for very large datasets.


**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these performance optimizations will not significantly alter the project's overall structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the ORM (Prisma), and the caching mechanism.  Monitoring tools will need to be integrated to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.


## Security

Security is paramount for any application handling sensitive financial data.  The following security measures will be implemented:

**1. Secure Connection Management:** All database connections will be established using SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.  This prevents eavesdropping and ensures that sensitive data is not intercepted by unauthorized parties.  The use of strong encryption ciphers will be enforced.

**2. Input Sanitization and Parameterized Queries:**  All user inputs will be carefully sanitized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Parameterized queries will be used consistently to prevent malicious code from being injected into database queries.  This is a fundamental security measure to protect against SQL injection attacks.

**3. Access Control:**  A robust access control mechanism will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.  This will involve defining roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific data and perform certain operations.  The principle of least privilege will be strictly adhered to, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

**4. Data Encryption:**  Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, financial information) will be encrypted at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.  This protects data even if the database server is compromised.  Key management will be implemented securely, using appropriate key rotation and protection mechanisms.

**5. Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.  These audits will help ensure that the database remains secure and protected against evolving threats.

**6. Secure Password Handling:**  Passwords will be stored using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with appropriate salting and peppering techniques.  This prevents passwords from being easily cracked even if the database is compromised.

**7. Regular Software Updates:**  The database software and related libraries will be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.

**8. Principle of Least Privilege:**  Database users will be granted only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.  This limits the potential damage caused by a compromised account.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these security measures will not significantly change the overall project structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the use of secure coding practices, and the integration of security tools and libraries.  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be incorporated into the development lifecycle.


## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Managing database schema changes effectively is crucial for maintaining a robust and reliable database.  This section details the migration strategy for the Stock Portfolio Application.

**1. Version Control:** All database migrations will be version-controlled using a dedicated system (e.g., Git).  This allows for tracking changes, reverting to previous versions if necessary, and ensuring that migrations are applied consistently across different environments.

**2. Migration Files:**  Each migration will be represented by a separate file containing the SQL statements required to update the database schema.  These files will be named according to a consistent convention (e.g., `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`).  This approach ensures that migrations are easily identifiable and manageable.

**3. Atomic Migrations:**  Each migration file will contain a single, atomic migration.  This ensures that if a migration fails, the database remains in a consistent state.  Partial migrations are avoided.

**4. Up and Down Migrations:**  Each migration will include both "up" and "down" migration scripts.  The "up" script applies the changes, while the "down" script reverts them.  This allows for easy rollback of migrations if necessary.

**5. Migration Tooling:**  Prisma's migration system will be used to manage the migration process.  This provides a convenient and reliable way to apply and rollback migrations.  The Prisma CLI will be used to generate, apply, and manage migration files.

**6. Testing Migrations:**  Migrations will be thoroughly tested before deployment to prevent unexpected issues.  This might involve running the migrations against a test database and verifying that the schema changes are applied correctly.

**7. Deployment Process:**  The migration process will be integrated into the application's deployment pipeline.  This ensures that migrations are applied automatically during deployment, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistency across environments.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A dedicated directory (e.g., `db/migrations`) will be created to store the migration files.  The migration process will be integrated into the deployment pipeline.  This structured approach ensures that database schema changes are managed effectively and reliably.


## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components and the database.

## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `transaction-management` subfolder will be added.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
├── transaction-management/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

# Stock Portfolio Application - Database Layer Design

## Introduction

This document details the design of the database layer for the Stock Portfolio Application. It incorporates the recommendations from the initial design proposal and addresses the additional considerations raised during the design review. The design prioritizes a clean architecture, testability, extensibility, and performance.

## Overall Architecture

The database layer will utilize the **Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter** as its primary architectural pattern. This pattern cleanly separates data access logic from the application's core business logic. The **Plugin Pattern** will be used to support multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite initially) and allow for easy addition of new providers in the future.

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of the following entities, based on the schema in `db/all.sql`:

* **User:** `USERS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `SURNAME` (TEXT), `EMAIL` (TEXT), `NICKNAME` (TEXT), `PASSWORD` (TEXT), `JOIN_DATE` (DATE)
* **Category:** `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT)
* **Stock:** `ISIN` (TEXT, PK), `CATEGORIES_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Category), `NAME` (TEXT), `WKN` (TEXT), `SYMBOL` (TEXT)
* **Quote:** `QUOTES_ID` (TEXT, PK), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `CURRENCY` (TEXT), `MARKET_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `EXCHANGE` (TEXT)
* **Portfolio:** `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `NAME` (TEXT), `CREATED_AT` (TIMESTAMP), `USERS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing User)
* **Holding:** `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `PORTFOLIOS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Portfolio), `ISIN` (TEXT, FK referencing Stock), `QUANTITY` (INT), `START_DATE` (DATE), `END_DATE` (DATE)
* **Transaction:** `TRANSACTIONS_ID` (TEXT, PK), `HOLDINGS_ID` (TEXT, FK referencing Holding), `BUY` (BOOLEAN), `TRANSACTION_TIME` (TIMESTAMP), `AMOUNT` (INT), `PRICE` (DECIMAL), `COMMISSION` (DECIMAL), `BROKER` (TEXT)

For a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, see the ER diagram: ![ER Diagram](db/model.png)


**Example Data Representation (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    USERS_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    surname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    join_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    CATEGORIES_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Stocks table
CREATE TABLE stocks (
    isin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    categories_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(categories_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    wkn TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Repository Implementation

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that decouples data access logic from the business logic of an application.  It introduces an abstraction layer, the `Repository`, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the data source (database).  This separation improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  The repository provides a consistent interface for accessing data, regardless of the underlying data source.  This allows for easy switching between different data sources (e.g., different databases or even in-memory data stores) without modifying the business logic.

The Repository Pattern is implemented here using interfaces and concrete implementations for each database provider.  The interface defines the methods for accessing data, while the concrete implementations provide the specific database interactions.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/interfaces/PortfolioRepository.ts
interface PortfolioRepository {
  create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Portfolio | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Portfolio[]>;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Plugin Pattern is a design pattern that allows for extending the functionality of an application at runtime without modifying its core code.  This is achieved by defining a plugin interface that specifies the methods that plugins must implement.  Plugins are then loaded dynamically, allowing for flexible and extensible application behavior.  This pattern is particularly useful for supporting multiple database providers, as it allows for adding new providers without recompiling or modifying the core application code.

In this design, the Plugin Pattern will be used to manage different database providers. Each provider will be implemented as a plugin that conforms to a defined plugin interface.  This allows for easy addition and removal of database providers without affecting the core application logic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin.ts
interface DatabasePlugin {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  getRepository<T extends Repository<any>>(repositoryType: { new (...args: any[]): T }): T;
  // ... other methods
}

// db/plugins/postgresql/PostgresqlPlugin.ts
import { DatabasePlugin } from '../plugin-interface/DatabasePlugin';
import { PostgresqlPortfolioRepository } from './PortfolioRepository';

class PostgresqlPlugin implements DatabasePlugin {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Centralized Error Handling:** A dedicated error handling module will be created to manage all database-related exceptions. This module will provide consistent error reporting and logging, regardless of the specific database provider or the type of error encountered.  This promotes maintainability and simplifies debugging.

**2. Custom Error Types:**  Specific error types will be defined to represent different types of database errors (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, `DataValidationError`). This improves error clarity and allows for more precise error handling in the application logic.

**3. Exception Handling in Repositories:** Each repository method will be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database operations.  Caught exceptions will be passed to the centralized error handling module for logging and processing.

**4. Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be generated, including timestamps, error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information (e.g., query parameters, affected data).  This information will be crucial for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.  The logging mechanism should be configurable to allow for different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and output destinations (e.g., console, file, centralized logging system).

**5. Consistent Error Responses:**  The centralized error handling module will ensure that consistent error responses are returned to the application.  These responses will provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  Error responses should follow a consistent format (e.g., JSON) and include appropriate HTTP status codes.

**6. Retries and Fallbacks:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability), the system will implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  For persistent errors, appropriate fallback mechanisms will be implemented to gracefully handle failures and prevent application crashes.

**Example (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// db/error-handling/ErrorHandler.ts
class ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: Error, context: any): void {
    // Log the error with context
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`, context);
    // ... other error handling logic (e.g., send error notification)
  }
}

// db/providers/postgresql/PortfolioRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../interfaces/PortfolioRepository';
import { ErrorHandler } from '../error-handling/ErrorHandler';

class PostgresqlPortfolioRepository implements PortfolioRepository {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;
  private errorHandler: ErrorHandler;

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }

  async create(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    try {
      return this.prisma.portfolio.create({ data: portfolio });
    } catch (error) {
      this.errorHandler.handleError(error, { operation: 'createPortfolio', portfolio });
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled by the calling function
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The addition of a centralized error handling module will require creating a new directory (`db/error-handling`) within the `db` folder.  This module will contain classes and functions for managing errors, logging, and generating consistent error responses.  The error handling logic will be integrated into the repository implementations and other database-related components.


## Transaction Management

Transaction management is critical for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database.  The strategy will ensure that database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and reliably.  This section details the design for transaction management in the Stock Portfolio Application's database layer.

**1. Transaction Boundaries:**  Transactions will be defined at the service layer, encompassing all database operations required for a single business operation (e.g., creating a new portfolio, executing a trade).  This ensures that all related operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.

**2. Transaction Isolation Levels:**  Appropriate transaction isolation levels (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE`, `READ COMMITTED`) will be chosen to prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.  The choice of isolation level will depend on the specific requirements of each transaction and the potential for concurrent access.

**3. Transaction Management in Repositories:**  Repository methods will not directly manage transactions.  Instead, the service layer will initiate and manage transactions, calling repository methods within the transaction scope.  This keeps transaction management logic separate from data access logic, improving code organization and testability.

**4. Error Handling within Transactions:**  Error handling within transactions is crucial.  If an error occurs during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency.  Appropriate error messages will be logged and returned to the application.

**5. Transaction Timeouts:**  Transaction timeouts will be implemented to prevent transactions from running indefinitely and blocking resources.  The timeout value will be configurable and will depend on the expected duration of the transaction.

**6. Distributed Transactions (Future Consideration):**  For future scalability, the design should consider the possibility of distributed transactions if the application needs to interact with multiple databases.  This will require a more sophisticated transaction management strategy, potentially using two-phase commit or other distributed transaction protocols.

**Example (TypeScript - Conceptual):**

```typescript
// db/services/portfolioService.ts
import { PortfolioRepository } from '../repositories/PortfolioRepository';
import { TransactionManager } from '../transaction-management/TransactionManager';

class PortfolioService {
  private portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository;
  private transactionManager: TransactionManager;

  constructor(portfolioRepository: PortfolioRepository, transactionManager: TransactionManager) {
    this.portfolioRepository = portfolioRepository;
    this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
  }

  async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
    return this.transactionManager.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
      // Access the database using the transaction object
      return this.portfolioRepository.create(portfolio, transaction);
    });
  }
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A new `transaction-management` directory will be added to the `db` folder. This directory will contain classes and functions for managing transactions, including initiating, committing, rolling back, and handling errors within transactions.  The transaction management logic will be integrated into the service layer.


## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.  A multi-layered approach will be implemented, combining validation at the application layer, service layer, and database layer.

**1. Application Layer Validation:**  Input validation will be performed at the application layer before data is passed to the service layer.  This initial validation will check for basic data types, required fields, and format constraints.  Libraries like Joi or Zod can be used for this purpose.

**2. Service Layer Validation:**  The service layer will perform additional validation to ensure data consistency and business rules are met.  This might include checking for data conflicts, verifying relationships between entities, and performing more complex validation logic.

**3. Database Layer Validation:**  Database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) and triggers will be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.  This ensures that invalid data cannot be inserted or updated into the database.

**Example (TypeScript - Application Layer with Joi):**

```typescript
// Assuming you are using Joi for validation
import * as Joi from 'joi';

const portfolioSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// Validate portfolio data
const { error, value } = portfolioSchema.validate(portfolioData);
if (error) {
  // Handle validation error
  throw new Error(`Invalid portfolio data: ${error.message}`);
}

// Use the validated data
const validatedPortfolio = value;
```

**Example (TypeScript - Service Layer Validation):**

```typescript
// ... in your service layer ...

async createPortfolio(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<Portfolio> {
  // Check for existing portfolio with the same name and user ID
  const existingPortfolio = await this.portfolioRepository.findByNameAndUserId(portfolio.name, portfolio.userId);
  if (existingPortfolio) {
    throw new Error('Portfolio with this name already exists for this user.');
  }
  // ... other validation and database operations ...
}
```

**Impact on Project Structure:**

The data validation logic will be distributed across the application, service, and database layers.  The application layer will use validation libraries, while the service layer will contain custom validation functions.  Database constraints and triggers will be defined in the database schema.  This approach ensures that validation is performed at multiple levels, providing a robust and comprehensive validation strategy.


## Performance Considerations

Database performance is critical for a responsive and scalable application.  The following strategies will be implemented to ensure optimal performance:

**1. Connection Pooling:** A connection pool will be used to manage database connections efficiently.  This avoids the overhead of establishing new connections for each database operation, significantly improving performance, especially under high load.  The pool size will be configured based on the expected load and available resources.

**2. Query Optimization:**  Database queries will be optimized to minimize resource consumption.  This includes using appropriate indexes, avoiding unnecessary joins, and using efficient query patterns.  Query execution plans will be analyzed using database tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.  The ORM (Prisma) will be leveraged for its built-in query optimization capabilities.

**3. Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.  The choice of indexes will depend on the application's query patterns and data access needs.  Index usage will be monitored to ensure that indexes are effective and not causing performance degradation in other areas.

**4. Caching:**  Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., stock quotes) will reduce the load on the database.  A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) will be implemented to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries.  The cache invalidation strategy will be carefully designed to ensure data consistency.

**5. Database Tuning:**  The database server will be tuned to optimize performance.  This includes configuring parameters such as buffer pool size, connection limits, and other performance-related settings.  Database monitoring tools will be used to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

**6. Read Replicas (Future Consideration):**  For high-read-load scenarios, read replicas can be implemented to distribute the read load across multiple database servers.  This will improve the responsiveness of read-heavy operations.

**7. Database Sharding (Future Consideration):**  For very large datasets, database sharding can be implemented to distribute data across multiple database servers.  This will improve scalability and performance for very large datasets.


**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these performance optimizations will not significantly alter the project's overall structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the ORM (Prisma), and the caching mechanism.  Monitoring tools will need to be integrated to track performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.


## Security

Security is paramount for any application handling sensitive financial data.  The following security measures will be implemented:

**1. Secure Connection Management:** All database connections will be established using SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.  This prevents eavesdropping and ensures that sensitive data is not intercepted by unauthorized parties.  The use of strong encryption ciphers will be enforced.

**2. Input Sanitization and Parameterized Queries:**  All user inputs will be carefully sanitized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Parameterized queries will be used consistently to prevent malicious code from being injected into database queries.  This is a fundamental security measure to protect against SQL injection attacks.

**3. Access Control:**  A robust access control mechanism will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.  This will involve defining roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific data and perform certain operations.  The principle of least privilege will be strictly adhered to, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

**4. Data Encryption:**  Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, financial information) will be encrypted at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.  This protects data even if the database server is compromised.  Key management will be implemented securely, using appropriate key rotation and protection mechanisms.

**5. Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.  These audits will help ensure that the database remains secure and protected against evolving threats.

**6. Secure Password Handling:**  Passwords will be stored using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with appropriate salting and peppering techniques.  This prevents passwords from being easily cracked even if the database is compromised.

**7. Regular Software Updates:**  The database software and related libraries will be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.

**8. Principle of Least Privilege:**  Database users will be granted only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.  This limits the potential damage caused by a compromised account.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

Implementing these security measures will not significantly change the overall project structure.  However, it will require careful configuration of the database server, the use of secure coding practices, and the integration of security tools and libraries.  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be incorporated into the development lifecycle.


## Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Database Providers:** PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)

## Migration Strategy

Managing database schema changes effectively is crucial for maintaining a robust and reliable database.  This section details the migration strategy for the Stock Portfolio Application.

**1. Version Control:** All database migrations will be version-controlled using a dedicated system (e.g., Git).  This allows for tracking changes, reverting to previous versions if necessary, and ensuring that migrations are applied consistently across different environments.

**2. Migration Files:**  Each migration will be represented by a separate file containing the SQL statements required to update the database schema.  These files will be named according to a consistent convention (e.g., `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`).  This approach ensures that migrations are easily identifiable and manageable.

**3. Atomic Migrations:**  Each migration file will contain a single, atomic migration.  This ensures that if a migration fails, the database remains in a consistent state.  Partial migrations are avoided.

**4. Up and Down Migrations:**  Each migration will include both "up" and "down" migration scripts.  The "up" script applies the changes, while the "down" script reverts them.  This allows for easy rollback of migrations if necessary.

**5. Migration Tooling:**  Prisma's migration system will be used to manage the migration process.  This provides a convenient and reliable way to apply and rollback migrations.  The Prisma CLI will be used to generate, apply, and manage migration files.

**6. Testing Migrations:**  Migrations will be thoroughly tested before deployment to prevent unexpected issues.  This might involve running the migrations against a test database and verifying that the schema changes are applied correctly.

**7. Deployment Process:**  The migration process will be integrated into the application's deployment pipeline.  This ensures that migrations are applied automatically during deployment, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistency across environments.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A dedicated directory (e.g., `db/migrations`) will be created to store the migration files.  The migration process will be integrated into the deployment pipeline.  This structured approach ensures that database schema changes are managed effectively and reliably.


## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and security of the database layer. This strategy will encompass several key aspects:

**1. Unit Testing:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components and functions within the database layer.  This includes testing repository methods, error handling logic, and transaction management functions.  Mocking will be used to isolate the units under test from external dependencies (e.g., the database).  Unit tests should focus on verifying the correctness of individual units in isolation.

**2. Integration Testing:** Integration tests will be written to test the interaction between different components within the database layer and with other parts of the application.  This includes testing the interaction between repositories and the database, the plugin loading mechanism, and the transaction management system.  Integration tests should verify that different components work together correctly.

**3. End-to-End Testing:** End-to-end tests will be written to test the entire database layer from start to finish, simulating real-world scenarios.  This includes testing the complete workflow of database operations, including data validation, error handling, and transaction management.  End-to-end tests should verify that the entire system functions as expected.

**4. Test Data Management:**  A robust test data management strategy will be implemented to ensure that tests are run against consistent and reliable data.  This might involve using test databases, seeding data, and generating test data.

**5. Test Coverage:**  Test coverage will be monitored to ensure that a sufficient portion of the codebase is covered by tests.  High test coverage is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the database layer.

**6. Continuous Integration:**  The testing process will be integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.  This ensures that tests are run automatically whenever code changes are made, providing early detection of potential issues.

**Impact on Project Structure:**

A dedicated directory (e.g., `db/tests`) will be created to store the test files.  The testing process will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.  This structured approach ensures that the database layer is thoroughly tested and that potential issues are identified early in the development process.


## File Structure Impact

The `db` folder will be restructured to accommodate the chosen architecture. The new structure will include subfolders for interfaces, providers, repositories, and plugins.  A new `transaction-management` subfolder will be added.

```
db/
├── interfaces/
├── providers/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── repositories/
├── plugins/
│   ├── postgresql/
│   └── sqlite/
├── error-handling/
├── transaction-management/
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the repository interfaces.
2. Implement the PostgreSQL and SQLite providers.
3. Implement the plugin architecture.
4. Implement the data model and migrations.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Implement error handling, transaction management, and data validation.
7. Optimize for performance and security.
