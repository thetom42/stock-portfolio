# AI Coding Assistant Guidelines for Stock Portfolio Project

## 1. Project Information

### Overview

The Stock Portfolio project is a full-stack application developed using AI tools. It serves as a comprehensive example of AI-assisted software development, with detailed documentation of the development process in the `cline` folder.

### Main Features

- Create, view, and manage stock portfolios
- Track stock holdings and transactions
- View stock quotes and historical data
- User-friendly interface for portfolio management
- Real-time market data integration
- Secure authentication and authorization

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript with React
- **Middleware**: NodeJS with ExpressJS (REST API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (Keycloak)
- **External APIs**: Yahoo Finance integration
- **Testing**: Mocha framework

## 2. Architectural and Design Guidelines

### Database Layer

- **ORM**:
  - The db repositories use the prisma client to make the db access.
  - The prisma schema of the DB layer is located in db/prisma/schema.prisma.
- **Patterns**: Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter, Plugin Pattern
- **Providers**: PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (secondary)
- **Key Features**:
  - Connection pooling for performance
  - Robust data validation
  - Secure data handling with encryption
  - Migration management system
  - Comprehensive testing strategy
- **Error Handling**:
  - Centralized error handling module
  - Custom error types
  - Consistent error responses
- **Transaction Management**:
  - Defined at service layer
  - Appropriate isolation levels
  - Timeout implementation

### BFF (Backend-For-Frontend) Layer

- **Architecture**:
  - Express.js with TypeScript
  - REST API principles
  - JWT authentication with Keycloak
  - Comprehensive middleware stack
- **Key Components**:
  - Controllers for HTTP requests
  - Services for business logic
  - Models for type-safe data handling
  - Middleware for auth, validation, and error handling
- **API Design**:
  - RESTful endpoints for all major operations
  - Versioned API endpoints
  - Consistent response formats
  - Comprehensive error handling
- **Misc**: The BFF layer uses the repositories of the DB layer for db access.

## 3. TypeScript Coding Guidelines

### General Principles

- Use strict type checking (`strict: true` in tsconfig)
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use readonly for immutable properties
- Avoid any type
- Use union and intersection types appropriately

### Code Organization

- Follow the project's layered architecture
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Use barrel files for cleaner imports
- Group related functionality in modules

### Error Handling

- Use custom error classes
- Implement type-safe error handling
- Use discriminated unions for error states
- Document error cases in function signatures

### Testing

- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Use type-safe mocks
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain high test coverage

### Best Practices

- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Implement proper type guards
- Use generics for reusable components
- Leverage utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit)
- Use decorators judiciously

## 4. General Instructions for Coding Assistant

### General Guidelines

- **Think Step by Step Before Acting**: Break down tasks into smaller steps. Consider each step carefully before proceeding.
- **Communicate Clearly**: If you encounter any issues or have questions, communicate them clearly and promptly.
- **Follow Instructions Closely**: Adhere strictly to the given instructions and requirements.
- **Documentation**: Write clear and concise documentation for the application, including setup instructions and API documentation. Document decisions and trade-offs.
- If you are not able to retrieve the command output from the Terminal, always ask the user to share the ouput.

### Project Understanding

- Review existing documentation before making changes
- Understand the layered architecture
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency with existing code

### Development Process

- Make small, focused changes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document changes in the appropriate files
- Follow the project's version control practices

### Code Quality

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions
- Write self-documenting code

### Security Considerations

- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies up-to-date

### Performance

- Optimize database queries
- Use caching where appropriate
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Monitor resource usage
- Profile and optimize critical paths
