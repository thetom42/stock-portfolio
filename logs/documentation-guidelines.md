# Documentation Guidelines

**thetom42**:

I am about to write a fullstack application webapp with frontend, bff and db layer and I want to do it with an AI coding agent. The purpose of this project is to show how useful an AI coding agent is for this task, what the benefits are and the shortcomings. I want to document as much as I can so that I can present it to Software Developer colleagues. Please give me a detailed list of aspects how to document the approach, eg. what measurements I should take or what illustrations should be included.

**GitHub Copilot (GPT 4o)**:

Sure! Here's a detailed list of aspects to document your approach for building a fullstack web application with an AI coding agent:

1. Project Overview

- Purpose: Explain the goal of the project and the role of the AI coding agent.
- Scope: Define the scope of the application (frontend, BFF, DB layer).
- Technologies Used: List the technologies and frameworks used (e.g., React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB).

2. Planning and Design

- Architecture Diagram: Include a high-level architecture diagram showing the interaction between frontend, BFF, and DB layers.
- User Stories: Document user stories and requirements.
- Wireframes: Create wireframes or mockups for the frontend.

3. Development Process

- Task Breakdown: Break down the project into smaller tasks and document them.
- AI Interaction: Document each interaction with the AI coding agent, including:
  - The prompt given to the AI.
  - The response from the AI.
  - Any modifications made to the AI-generated code.
- Code Reviews: Include before and after code snippets to show improvements or corrections.

4. Measurements and Metrics

- Time Tracking: Track the time spent on each task, both with and without the AI.
- Code Quality: Use tools like ESLint, Prettier, and SonarQube to measure code quality.
- Performance Metrics: Measure the performance of the application (e.g., response times, load times).

5. Benefits and Shortcomings

- Efficiency: Document how the AI coding agent improved efficiency (e.g., time saved).
- Accuracy: Note any errors or inaccuracies in the AI-generated code.
- Learning Curve: Describe the learning curve associated with using the AI coding agent.
- Collaboration: Discuss how the AI coding agent impacted team collaboration.

6. Illustrations and Visuals

- Screenshots: Include screenshots of the development process, code snippets, and the final application.
- Charts and Graphs: Use charts to illustrate time savings, code quality improvements, and performance metrics.
- Flowcharts: Create flowcharts to show the workflow and decision-making process.

7. Testing and Validation

- Unit Tests: Document the unit tests written for the application.
- Integration Tests: Include integration tests to ensure all components work together.
- User Testing: Document feedback from user testing sessions.

8. Deployment

- Deployment Process: Describe the deployment process and tools used (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
- CI/CD Pipeline: Document the CI/CD pipeline setup.

9. Conclusion and Reflection

- Summary: Summarize the overall experience of using the AI coding agent.
- Lessons Learned: Document any lessons learned and best practices.
- Future Work: Suggest areas for future improvement or additional features.

10. Appendices

- Code Samples: Include significant code samples generated by the AI.
- Resources: List any resources, tutorials, or documentation used during the project.

By documenting these aspects, you'll provide a comprehensive overview of the project and the role of the AI coding agent, highlighting both its benefits and shortcomings.
