   - Authentication and authorization
   - External service integration (Yahoo Finance)
   - Error handling and validation

### Remaining Work

   - User interface development
   - State management
   - API integration

2. Testing
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Performance testing

3. Deployment
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Production environment configuration
   - Monitoring and logging setup

## Prompting Techniques Analysis

### Identified Patterns

1. **Clear Task Definition**
   - Tasks were broken down into specific, manageable chunks
   - Clear objectives and expected outcomes were provided
   - Example: "Create BFF Design Document" followed by "Create BFF File Structure"

2. **Iterative Development**
   - Development proceeded in logical steps
   - Each task built upon previous work
   - Example: DB design → DB implementation → BFF design → BFF implementation

3. **Context Provision**
   - Relevant files and documentation were referenced
   - Previous decisions were explained
   - Example: DB design discussions were referenced during implementation

4. **Validation Requirements**
   - Clear acceptance criteria were provided
   - Test requirements were specified
   - Example: Unit test requirements for repositories

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Documentation First**
   - Design documents were created before implementation
   - Architecture decisions were documented
   - Example: DB design document and BFF design document

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Tests were specified before implementation
   - Coverage requirements were defined
   - Example: Repository unit tests

3. **Incremental Complexity**
   - Started with core functionality
   - Gradually added more complex features
   - Example: Basic CRUD operations before advanced queries

4. **Code Review Integration**
   - Implementation was reviewed and validated
   - Feedback was incorporated into subsequent tasks
   - Example: DB design review and improvements

## Critical Review
