# Guidelines for Documenting an AI Agent Based Coding Project

## Project Overview

- Purpose: Explain the goal of the project and the role of the AI coding agent.
- Scope: Define the scope of the application (frontend, BFF, DB layer).
- Technologies Used: List the technologies and frameworks used (e.g., React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB).

## Planning and Design

- Architecture Diagram: Include a high-level architecture diagram showing the interaction between frontend, BFF, and DB layers.
- User Stories: Document user stories and requirements.
- Wireframes: Create wireframes or mockups for the frontend.

## Development Process

- Task Breakdown: Break down the project into smaller tasks and document them.
- AI Interaction: Document each interaction with the AI coding agent, including:
- The prompt given to the AI.
- The response from the AI.
- Any modifications made to the AI-generated code.
- Code Reviews: Include before and after code snippets to show improvements or corrections.

## Measurements and Metrics

- Time Tracking: Track the time spent on each task, both with and without the AI.
- Code Quality: Use tools like ESLint, Prettier, and SonarQube to measure code quality.
- Performance Metrics: Measure the performance of the application (e.g., response times, load times).

## Benefits and Shortcomings

- Efficiency: Document how the AI coding agent improved efficiency (e.g., time saved).
- Accuracy: Note any errors or inaccuracies in the AI-generated code.
- Learning Curve: Describe the learning curve associated with using the AI coding agent.
- Collaboration: Discuss how the AI coding agent impacted team collaboration.

## Illustrations and Visuals

- Screenshots: Include screenshots of the development process, code snippets, and the final application.
- Charts and Graphs: Use charts to illustrate time savings, code quality improvements, and performance metrics.
- Flowcharts: Create flowcharts to show the workflow and decision-making process.

## Testing and Validation

- Unit Tests: Document the unit tests written for the application.
- Integration Tests: Include integration tests to ensure all components work together.
- User Testing: Document feedback from user testing sessions.

## Deployment

- Deployment Process: Describe the deployment process and tools used (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
- CI/CD Pipeline: Document the CI/CD pipeline setup.

## Conclusion and Reflection

- Summary: Summarize the overall experience of using the AI coding agent.
- Lessons Learned: Document any lessons learned and best practices.
- Future Work: Suggest areas for future improvement or additional features.

## Appendices

- Code Samples: Include significant code samples generated by the AI.
- Resources: List any resources, tutorials, or documentation used during the project.
- By documenting these aspects, you'll provide a comprehensive overview of the project and the role of the AI coding agent, highlighting both its benefits and shortcomings.
