# Database Layer Design Options

## Overview
This document outlines design options for implementing a database abstraction layer that supports multiple database providers (PostgreSQL and SQLite) for the stock portfolio application.

## Design Patterns & Architecture Options

### 1. Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter Pattern
#### Description
- Implement a repository interface for each domain entity (Portfolio, Stock, Transaction, etc.)
- Use Strategy/Adapter pattern to switch between different database implementations
- Each database provider implements the repository interfaces

#### Benefits
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new database providers
- Domain logic remains isolated from data access logic
- Testable through interface mocking

#### Structure
```
db/
  ├── interfaces/         # Repository interfaces
  ├── providers/         # Database-specific implementations
  │   ├── postgresql/
  │   └── sqlite/
  └── repositories/      # Concrete repository implementations
```

### 2. Data Mapper Pattern with Factory
#### Description
- Implement data mappers that handle the transformation between domain objects and database records
- Use factory pattern to create appropriate data mapper instances
- Database-specific logic encapsulated in mapper implementations

#### Benefits
- Clear separation between domain objects and database records
- Flexible object-relational mapping
- Good for complex domain models

### 3. Active Record with Provider Abstraction
#### Description
- Domain models include data access methods
- Abstract database operations behind provider interface
- Models use provider interface for operations

#### Benefits
- Simpler implementation for straightforward CRUD operations
- Less boilerplate code
- Good for simpler domain models

### 4. Plugin Pattern
#### Description
- Define a plugin interface for database operations
- Allow database providers to be loaded dynamically at runtime
- Support hot-swapping of database implementations
- Enable third-party database provider extensions

#### Benefits
- Runtime extensibility without application modifications
- Dynamic loading/unloading of database providers
- Third-party provider integration without core code changes
- Flexible architecture for future database support

#### Structure
```
db/
  ├── plugin-interface/  # Core plugin interfaces
  ├── plugin-loader/     # Dynamic loading mechanism
  ├── core-providers/    # Built-in database plugins
  └── external/          # Third-party provider plugins
```

## Recommended Programming Languages & ORMs

### 1. TypeScript/Node.js
#### ORMs/Query Builders:
- **Prisma**
  - Type-safe database access
  - Excellent migration support
  - Support for PostgreSQL and SQLite
  - Auto-generated client
  
- **TypeORM**
  - Flexible ORM with good TypeScript support
  - Supports multiple database providers
  - Active community
  - Built-in migration support

### 2. Python
#### ORMs:
- **SQLAlchemy**
  - Mature and powerful ORM
  - Excellent database abstraction
  - Strong typing support with recent versions
  - Comprehensive migration tools (Alembic)

- **Peewee**
  - Lighter weight alternative
  - Simple to use
  - Good for smaller applications

### 3. Go
#### Database Tools:
- **GORM**
  - Full-featured ORM
  - Good performance
  - Auto-migrations
  - Multiple database support

- **SQLx**
  - Type-safe SQL builder
  - Excellent performance
  - Compile-time query validation

## Recommended Utility Scripts

### 1. Migration Scripts
- Schema version control
- Up/down migrations
- Seed data management
- Migration history tracking

### 2. Testing Utilities
- Database mocking utilities
- Test data generators
- Integration test helpers
- Performance testing tools

### 3. Administration Scripts
- Database initialization
- Backup/restore utilities
- Health check scripts
- Data validation tools

### 4. Development Tools
- Schema visualization
- Query logging/debugging
- Performance monitoring
- Database connection management

## Recommendation

Based on the current project structure and requirements, the recommended approach is:

1. **Primary Pattern**: Repository Pattern with Strategy/Adapter
   - Provides clean separation of concerns
   - Makes testing straightforward
   - Allows easy addition of new database providers

2. **Complementary Pattern**: Plugin Pattern
   - While the Repository Pattern provides the core architecture, incorporating aspects of the Plugin Pattern offers valuable extensibility
   - Enables future third-party database provider integration
   - Allows for dynamic provider loading without application rebuilds
   - Consider implementing for non-critical database providers or experimental features

3. **Language/ORM**: TypeScript with Prisma
   - Type safety
   - Excellent developer experience
   - Good integration with Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem
   - Strong migration support
   - Matches the existing project stack (based on the BFF folder structure)

4. **Key Utilities to Implement**:
   - Migration management system
   - Seeding system for test data
   - Integration test helpers
   - Connection pooling and management
   - Query logging for development
   - Plugin management system for dynamic provider loading

This combination provides a robust foundation while maintaining flexibility for future changes and additions to the database layer. The Repository Pattern ensures a stable core architecture, while the Plugin Pattern capabilities enable extensibility and future adaptability without compromising the system's reliability.
